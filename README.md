The goal of this project is to document and reinforce my understanding of key Python tools used in real-world data workflows, including:

- ðŸ“ˆ **NumPy** â€“ Numerical computing and array manipulation
- ðŸ§® **Pandas** â€“ Data manipulation and analysis
- ðŸ“Š **Matplotlib** â€“ Data visualization (basic plots, histograms, etc.)
- ðŸŽ¨ **Seaborn** â€“ Statistical data visualization built on top of Matplotlib
- ðŸ“‘ **Working with Excel** â€“ Reading/writing Excel files using Pandas

Each notebook (`.ipynb`) includes:
- Key concepts and syntax explanations
- Code examples
- Visualizations
- Practical use cases

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amar-verma/Data-Analysis-Notes.git

I created these notes as part of my ongoing learning, revision, and practice. Anyone beginning with data analysis in Python might also find these helpful.
